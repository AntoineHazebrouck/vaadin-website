about.hobbies.listen.dialog.p1=As a self-taught musician, I learned guitar, bass and the basics of music theory which allowed me to sketch songs. To give them shape, I had to learn a DAW (Ableton).
about.hobbies.listen.dialog.p2=Since I only play guitar and bass, the songs are quite raw — they basically miss drums and vocals; with those they could become proper mixes.

experiences.socgen.title=Software Engineer Apprentice
experiences.socgen.subtitle=Société Générale - La Défense
experiences.socgen.text1=In an international context, I created, improved, and maintained a large chain of tools addressing the group's structural risks and steering needs for the financial department.
experiences.socgen.text2=Specifically, within the data quality team, I implemented the consolidation, consistency, and qualitative validation of the group's balance sheet.
experiences.socgen.text3=I also had the opportunity to lead a complete project for calibrating the internal balance sheet on an agile basis, prioritizing client satisfaction.

# data classifier project page
projects.data-classifier.title=Data classifier
projects.data-classifier.subtitle=Second-year undergraduate project
projects.data-classifier.p1=Desktop application allowing the visual exploration of a dataset (two dimensional) and the application of a linear classifier.
projects.data-classifier.p2=We were three on this project, I was assigned to creating the UI while my teammates were working on the classification model. The classifying logic was recreated from scratch so we had to code all the math behind the model.
projects.data-classifier.p3=The UI was built with JavaFX (as per the requirement), which was a struggle as well as a blessing. Being able to code the UI logic in Java helped and the base library is very complete, yet it was very hard to find documentation especially on the .exe bundling.

# services ads project page
projects.services-ads.title=Services ads social network
projects.services-ads.subtitle=Third-year undergraduate project
projects.services-ads.p1=Exclusive web/mobile network allowing users to post/view all kinds of ads (babysitting, gardening, ...) to offer/ask for services. This was a give and take situation were an entrepreneur would drive us into making their ideas concrete.
projects.services-ads.p2=We were a team of 8 assigned with an entrepreneur, we had to complete the whole application within one week : from the simplest idea to production. We simulated an agility client/customer relationship where one day is a sprint. This allowed us to refine the unclear needs from our client : provide fast results (demos), get feedback and act on it for the next sprint. 
projects.services-ads.p3=We split ourselves into 3 subteams : infrastructure, UI and backend (which I was part of). Here is the stack : UI -> Expo with Typescript, Backend -> Spring Boot with Java, Postgres, Infrastructure -> GCP, Kubernetes, Docker.
projects.services-ads.p4=The hardest part was to obtain clear specifications from our client since the initial idea was not thoroughly thought. We had to do a lot of remodeling and prototyping to steer the project as we went. This is the first project that had me working in a whole project lifecycle, it defeinitly taught me how to work with a client : what they expect, what to focus on and when.
projects.services-ads.p5=We eventually managed to make it to production with a simple but decent cross-platform application that covered most of our client's requirements.

# MegaStorageRemote project page
projects.megastorage.title=Android remote for MegaStorage 300CD
projects.megastorage.subtitle=Allows me to control my 'jukebox' CD player easily
projects.megastorage.p1=This CD player lets you add 300 CDs, yet you need to keep paper notes of which CD is at which position inside e.g. : 'Depeche Mode - Music for the Masses' is at position 23. Paper means you cannot modify it, search for names, and so on.
projects.megastorage.p2=I wanted to software-ize this paper list, so I looked through a few ways to control the CD player using code. I had three options : simulating a keyboard via PS/2, using a dedicated data port, or simulating a remote via infrared. The keyboard option was tricky because it is mostly dedicated to entering CD metadata. The data port was too proprietary to figure out (connectics, protocols, ...). So the only option left was infrared, and it turned ou that my Xiaomi phone has an infrared emitter.
projects.megastorage.p3=It looks easy on the surface, however infrared handling was a real challenge. There are no standards in infrared, everything is proprierary and this device especially is niche. Finding the proper infrared codes that correspond to the official remote buttons definitly had to be done through retro-engineering.
projects.megastorage.p4=To retrieve all the infrared codes, I wired an infrared emitter component to a RaspberryPi and set up the necessary software on the Raspberry. Then I could press the remote's buttons, and the codes would show up in the ssh console. I had to make sure to get the codes in straight 'binary' (up/down times) and reformat them so that I could use them in my own code.
projects.megastorage.p5=I managed to turn on and off my CD player through a button in my android app. From that point onward, it was just software implementation. Still, the aim was not to reproduce the remote but to replace the paper list to turn it into a 'Spotify-like' app. I used C# with .NET for Android to build the application to learn the language. The only challenge was the precision of the infrared blasts, espacially with combined instructions. For example, if I want to play 'Depeche Mode - Music for the Masses' which is at position 23, the app actually blasts 5 commands in a sequence : 'Choose disc', 'Two', 'Three', 'Enter', 'Play'. This is tackled by sending the given code 2 to 3 times in a row to make sure, but even with that the precision is not 100%.

# VaadinWebsite project page
projects.vaadin_website.title=Web portfolio
projects.vaadin_website.p1=I had to update/modernize my former portfolio. So I took this as an opportunity to try new technologies.
projects.vaadin_website.p2=I am mainly a Java developer, so I was looking for ways to create modern applications avoiding the JavaScript ecosystem. The most promising fit I found was Vaadin, which allows me to build single page applications straight in Java, without HTML/JavaScript. Also, it lets me benefit from all my Spring Boot knowledge.
projects.vaadin_website.p3=The primary struggle is that the website is server-driven, so it is hard to combine with client-side scripting (UI libraries). And it is more expensive to run as well : 5€/month for the Heroku infrastructure and 1€/month for the domain name. Still the advantage is the flexibility : I can have an email contact feature straight away, and I can keep track of users behavior (buttons clicked, where they look, ...).
