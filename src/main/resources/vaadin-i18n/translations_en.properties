# MegaStorageRemote project page
projects.megastorage.title=Android remote for MegaStorage 300CD
projects.megastorage.subtitle=Allows me to control my 'jukebox' CD player easily
projects.megastorage.p1=This CD player lets you add 300 CDs, yet you need to keep paper notes of which CD is at which position inside e.g. : 'Depeche Mode - Music for the Masses' is at position 23. Paper means you cannot modify it, search for names, and so on.
projects.megastorage.p2=I wanted to software-ize this paper list, so I looked through a few ways to control the CD player using code. I had three options : simulating a keyboard via PS/2, using a dedicated data port, or simulating a remote via infrared. The keyboard option was tricky because it is mostly dedicated to entering CD metadata. The data port was too proprietary to figure out (connectics, protocols, ...). So the only option left was infrared, and it turned ou that my Xiaomi phone has an infrared emitter.
projects.megastorage.p3=It looks easy on the surface, however infrared handling was a real challenge. There are no standards in infrared, everything is proprierary and this device especially is niche. Finding the proper infrared codes that correspond to the official remote buttons definitly had to be done through retro-engineering.
projects.megastorage.p4=To retrieve all the infrared codes, I wired an infrared emitter component to a RaspberryPi and set up the necessary software on the Raspberry. Then I could press the remote's buttons, and the codes would show up in the ssh console. I had to make sure to get the codes in straight 'binary' (up/down times) and reformat them so that I could use them in my own code.
projects.megastorage.p5=I managed to turn on and off my CD player through a button in my android app. From that point onward, it was just software implementation. Still, the aim was not to reproduce the remote but to replace the paper list to turn it into a 'Spotify-like' app. I used C# with .NET for Android to build the application to learn the language. The only challenge was the precision of the infrared blasts, espacially with combined instructions. For example, if I want to play 'Depeche Mode - Music for the Masses' which is at position 23, the app actually blasts 5 commands in a sequence : 'Choose disc', 'Two', 'Three', 'Enter', 'Play'. This is tackled by sending the given code 2 to 3 times in a row to make sure, but even with that the precision is not 100%.

# VaadinWebsite page
projects.vaadin_website.title=Web portfolio
projects.vaadin_website.p1=I had to update/modernize my former portfolio. So I took this as an opportunity to try new technologies.
projects.vaadin_website.p2=I am mainly a Java developer, so I was looking for ways to create modern applications avoiding the JavaScript ecosystem. The most promising fit I found was Vaadin, which allows me to build single page applications straight in Java, without HTML/JavaScript. Also, it lets me benefit from all my Spring Boot knowledge.
projects.vaadin_website.p3=The primary struggle is that the website is server-driven, so it is hard to combine with client-side scripting (UI libraries). And it is more expensive to run as well : 5€/month for the Heroku infrastructure and 1€/month for the domain name.
